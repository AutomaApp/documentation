# Conditions Block

Add conditional logic to the workflow.

When this block is executing, it will check every condition you have built. If it matches the condition, the workflow continues to the block that connects with the condition output. If there's no match, the workflow will continue to the block connects with the `fallback` output.

Open the [condition builder](../reference/condition-builder.md) page to see how to build a condition.
