# Active Tab Block

Set the current tab that you're in as an active tab. __Active tab__ in this context is a tab where the block required a tab like a take screenshot block will execute.

For example, when you want to take a screenshot or execute a javascript code on a website that you're in, you can use the active tab first before connecting others block like the [take a screenshot](/blocks/take-screenshot.md) or [javascript code block](/blocks/javascript-code.md).
