# Active Tab Block

Set the current tab that you're in as an active tab. __Active tab__ in this context is a tab where the block in the web interaction category or a block that is required a tab like a take screenshot block will execute.

For example, when you want to take a screenshot or execute a javascript code on a website that you're in, you can use the active tab first before connecting others block like the take a screenshot or javascript code block.

Because this block uses the tab you're in as an active tab, you need to execute the workflow from the Automa popup or use the [keyboard shortcut trigger](/blocks/#keyboard-shortcut).
