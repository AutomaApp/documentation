# New Window Block

Create a new window.

## Window State

- **normal** <br>
	The window is at the default size or user-selected size.

- **minimized** <br>
	The window is only visible as an icon in the taskbar.

- **maximized** <br>
	The window fills the screen on which it is displayed not including any screen areas reserved by the operating system.

- **fullscreen** <br>
	The window is running as a full screen application.

## Incognito Window

Set the new window as an incognito window. To use this option, you must enable the "Allow in Incognito" for the Automa extension. 

You can find this option by going to `chrome://extensions` => find Automa => scroll down
