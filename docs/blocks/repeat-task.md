# Repeat Task Block

Repeat execute a block or multiple blocks.

![Repeat task block example](https://res.cloudinary.com/chat-story/image/upload/v1642236750/automa/chrome_NLkqno9pxO_hbudur.png)

To use this block, you must connect the second output (`Repeat from`) to the block you want to repeat from. When you execute the workflow and reach the repeat task block, Automa will start over executing the block that connects with the second output ([Get text](/blocks/get-text) block). You can define how many times it is repeated in the provided input.
