# Switch Tab Block

Switch between tab

## Match Pattern
URL pattern of the tab. For example, `https://google.com/*` Automa will switch into a tab that has a `google.com` domain.
You can see more examples of the match pattern on the [MDN Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns#examples).

## Create If No Match
If there's no URL of the tab that matches the patterns, Automa will create a new tab based on the inputted URL.
