# Loop Breakpoint

Set the breakpoint for the [loop data block](/blocks/loop-data.html#breakpoint). You must input the [loop id](/blocks/loop-data.md#loop-id) of the loop data block when using this block.

## Stop Loop
It will stop the loop that corresponds with the loop id you input and continue the execution to the next block.
