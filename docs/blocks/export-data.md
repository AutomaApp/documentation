# Export data block

Export [data columns](/api-reference/data-columns) or [google sheets](/blocks/google-sheets) data as JSON, CSV, or plain text file.

When you select the google sheets option, you also must input the `reference key` so Automa can know which google sheets data you want to export.
<br/> You can find the `reference key` when you edit the google sheets block.
