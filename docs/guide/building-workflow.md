# Building a Workflow
This section will show how to automate a task and build your first workflow. In Automa, there are two ways to build a workflow:
1. By recording your actions on the web
2. Manually

## Recording Actions

This is the easiest way to build a workflow in Automa. To get started, open the Automa dashboard by clicking the Automa icon on the top right. After that, click the arrow down icon and select the "Record workflow" menu.

When Automa starts recording, it will record all your actions, like creating a new tab, scrolling, clicking, and typing.
While recording, you can also select an element to retrieve the text or attribute value from it.
