# Reference data
You can use this feature to add dynamic data in the input of a block, like in the element selector or the form value. Automa uses the mustache templating (<code v-pre>{{ mustache }}</code>) syntax to know which input is dynamic or not.

Inside the mustache tag, you can either write the keyword of data you want to get from or a function, for example <code v-pre>{{ globalData }}</code> to get the global data of the workflow.

## Accessing data
There're several sources of data that you can input:

| keyword | description |
| --- | --- |
| `dataColumns` | Get data from the [data columns](./data-columns.md) |
| `loopData` | Get the current iteration data from the [loop data](/blocks/loop-data) block |
| `prevBlockData` | Get the data of the previous block |
| `globalData` | Get the global data of the workflow |
| `activeTabUrl` | Get the currently active tab url |

When you write <code v-pre>{{ dataColumns }}</code> in an input of a block, the mustache tag will be replaced with all the data from the [data columns](./data-columns.md).

If you want to get specific data from row or column of the data columns, you can write a mustache tag with <code v-pre>{{ dataColumns@path }}</code> syntax, the `path` is where you write the dot notation of the data. For example, data columns have data like these:

| `name` | `price` | `url` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Car | 4000 | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car |
| Motorcycle | 2000 | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle |

When it converts to JSON, it'll be an array of objects like these.

```json
[
  { "name": "Car", "price": 4000, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car" },
  { "name": "Motorcycle", "price": 2000, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle" }
]
```
To get the first row or index of the data columns, you can write <code v-pre>{{ dataColumns@0 }}</code>, and the output would be `{ "name": "Car", "price": 4000, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car" }`. And if you want to get the name column from the first row, you can write <code v-pre>{{ dataColumns@0.name }}</code>, and the output would be `Car`.

You can also apply this syntax to the other keyword like the `globalData` if the data type is an array or an object.

## Functions
Inside the mustache tag, you also can call a built-in function that Automa has provided. Function name always starts with a dollar sign ($), for example <code v-pre>{{ $func() }}</code>. And here are some of the functions that you can call inside a mustache tag.

### `$date(date, dateFormat?)`
You can use this function to get or format a date. This function takes two parameters, which the second parameter is optional. 

If you want to format the current date, you can directly pass the `dateFormat` as the first parameter, like <code v-pre>{{ $date('DD-MMMM-YYYY') }}</code>, and the output would be `14-January-2022`. You can see all the available date formats on the [day.js page](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format#list-of-all-available-formats).

And for the `date` parameter, you can see the valid date format on the [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#examples).

**Examples**
```js:no-v-pre
$date('DD MMMM YYYY') // 14 January 2022
$date('DD-MM-YYYY, hh:mm A')  // 14-01-2022, 02:24 PM
$date('relative') // A few seconds ago

$date('2005-06-07', 'DD MMMM YYYY') // 07 June 2005
$date('1977-04-01T14:00:30', 'DD-MM-YYYY, hh:mm A')  // 01-04-1977, 02:00 PM
$date('14 January 2021', 'relative') // A year ago
```

### `$randint(min, max)`

Generate a random number. You can change the range of the random number generated by inputting the `min` and `max` parameters.

**Examples**
```js
$randint() // 30
$randint() // 14

$randint(0, 10) // 4
$randint(0, 10) // 7
```

<!-- In `keyword` write the source of the data, there are three sources where you can get the data from:

1. `dataColumns`: get data from the data columns.
2. `loopData`: get the iteration data from the [loop data block](https://github.com/Kholid060/automa/wiki/Blocks/_edit#loop-data).
3. `prevBlockData`: get data from the previous block.
4. `globalData`: get the global data that you have defined.
5. `activeTabUrl`: get the currently active tab url.


And `path` is where you write the key of the data and nested key also supported. The syntax is could be different on each of the sources of the data

### Data columns
Because the data of data columns is an array of objects that looks like this
```js
[
  { city: 'london', country: 'england' },
  { city: 'ottawa', country: 'canada' },
  { city: 'jakarta', country: 'Indonesia' },
]
```
To get the first data, you can write `{{ dataColumns@0.city }}` and the output would be `London`. To get the second data write `{{ dataColumns@1.city }}` and so on.

### Loop data
To get the iteration data of the [loop data block](https://github.com/Kholid060/automa/wiki/Blocks/_edit#loop-data), you must write the loop ID first before the `path` for example `{{ loopData@loopID.path }}`.

### Previous block data
Get data from the previous block. Because all blocks are returning data, like a get text block that returns the text that it got from the element. To get the data, write `{{ prevBlockData }}`. -->
