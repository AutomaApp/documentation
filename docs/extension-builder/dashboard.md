This page is where you add, update, and delete the workflows of the extension.
2. [Details](./details.md) <br />
Edit the extension details like the name, description, and extension icon.
3. [Customize](./customize.md) <br />
The page where you can customize the extension interface or inject a custom script into the extension.
4. [Crash Logs](./crash-logs.md) <br />
Find the logs of errors that occur when running a workflow on the extension.
5. Analytics <br />
See the analytics of the extension (installed count, active users, and workflow executions).
