## Colors
Change the extension colors, like the primary color, secondary, background, text, etc.

## Custom Script
Add a custom script that will be injected into the extension.

### HTML
HTML code to inject into the extension, you can select the position of the HTML that will be injected on the "HTML Position" selection.

### CSS

### JavaScript
Custom javascript to inject to the extension. There are several global variables you can use inside the javascript code. Like `$helper` and `chrome`; open the [Global Variables page](./global-variables.md) for more details.
