# Installing Extension

The extension zip file you downloaded from the Automa Chrome Extension Builder dashboard; can be installed on a Chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc. 

To install the extension to one of those browsers:
1. Open the `chrome://extensions` page
2. On that page, enable the "Developer mode" switch on the top right if you're using Google Chrome.
3. Drag and drop the extension zip into that page.
