# Variables

Variables are used to store a value, and you can access this value throughout the workflow.

For example, you can store the retrieved text by the [Get Text block](../blocks/get-text.md) inside a variable and access that variable in another block.

## Variable Name

You can name the variable to whatever you want. But to make it easier to access the variable inside a mustache tag, don't include space, at (@), and bracket ([]) sign in the variable name.
