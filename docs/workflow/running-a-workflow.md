# Running a Workflow

::: danger
While the workflow is running, don't close the Automa popup. Because it will not run when you close it.
:::

You can run a workflow by opening the Automa dashboard and clicking the play icon (<v-remixicon name="riPlayLine" />) on the workflow you want to run.

Or you can open Automa Shortcut by pressing <kbd>Ctrl/âŒ˜+Shift+E</kbd> on a page and select the workflow.
