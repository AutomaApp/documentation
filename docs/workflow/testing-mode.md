# Testing Mode
Testing mode allows you to test and debug your Automa workflow. 

You can test each step of the workflow and verify the output of each step without the need to execute the entire workflow. Click the <v-remixicon name="riBug2Line" /> icon to enter the workflow into testing mode.

## Breakpoint

When the workflow is in Testing Mode, you'll see the <v-remixicon name="riRecordCircleLine" /> icon on the workflow blocks. It's used to set the block as the breakpoint. Breakpoint is designed to point in the workflow where the execution of the workflow will be paused, allowing you to inspect the state of the workflow and its variables.
